# bevy_neat
This plugin provides an implementation of the NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm for the Bevy game engine, enabling the integration of NEAT into your Bevy project.

## Features
- An efficnent, modular, and extendable implementation of the NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm in Rust, modeled after the NEAT Paper.
- Easy integration into your bevy project.
- Saving and loading of populations, allowing you to pause and continue evolution between multiple executions and iterations of your project.
- Saving and loading of individual neural networks.
- Concurrent populations and concurrent genome evaluation.

## Note
This project is in its early stages. At its current state, most core features have yet to be implemented.
